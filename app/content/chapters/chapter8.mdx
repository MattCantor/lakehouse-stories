Dolly and Fiona are in the same class in the foresthood school.
Its a small school, so each class has three different ages.
Dolly is 8. Fiona is 10.
There are some nine year old animals in the class too.

One summer morning, Penny the Porcupine meets Dolly and Fiona on the way to school.
Together, they walk to Rachel the Rabbit's classroom.
This morning the class is being held in the ampitheater.

"Hello Ms. Rachel", says Penny.

"Today we are going to have a lesson about predators," says Mrs. Rachel.

"I'm a predator", says Fiona.

nOutside the school, Wally is walking around.
He sees two twigs outside the ampitheater.
Suddenly, the twigs snaps and a small fire starts.
The fire quickly spreads.

"I better warn Rachel and the other teachers," Wally thinks to himself.

But just then, the fire spreads and blocks his path. He can't get through!

Rachel is the first to smell the fire.
She goes to investigate further, then quickly turns around and hops back to the class.

"Attention everyone! Forest Fire! This is not a drill!
Quickly, head towards the lake. Collect as much water as you can.
And remember, do not drink the water!"

Dolly asks, "What about the younger kids? They are going to be so scared."

"Well if we collect a lot of water and put out the fire, they'll be ok", Penny says.
"Remember what you taught us in our forest fire safety course?
We should make a fireman's brigade to bring the water to the fire!"

"Oh you are right Penny! I'm so glad you listened in class!"

Fiona says, "if anyone gets scared during the fireman's brigade, just pretent you are playing hot potato :)"

The fireman's brigade works! The kids are able to put out the fire.
Mostly by pretending to play hot potato.
Wally escapes unharmed.
