Bennie the Bear loved to eat trash.
If he ever found a piece of trash while meandering through the forest, he would return there again and again looking for more.
He often visting people's yards, and stole their garbage.
One day he heard a story about a treasure of garbage at the bottom of the lake.
Bennie was very excited!
He though he could try swim down to the bottom of the lake to find the garbage.

So he tried.
Down at the bottom of the lake, he found a pile of old nasty moldy trash, and he sunk his teeth in.
But most of it disintergrated into silt.
There were only six real pieces of garbage to speak of.
Bennie knew this couldn't be the real treasure that he heard about.
So he kept searching.
He found three more pieces of trash at the bottom of the lake, arranged in a single file line.
He kept searching for the rest of the day, but didn't have much luck.
Just a little bit of trash, here and there.

When he was done, he went straight to find his bear friends. He told them, "you were wrong, dude!"
