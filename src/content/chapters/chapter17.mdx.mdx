Prologue

Once there was chicken sailor, named Chahab.  He was sailing in the lake near, Mr. Finnigan's lakehouse.  He was hunting sperm whales.  Not many people knew that there were whales in the lake.  But Chahab's family had been hunting these waters for generations.

Suddenly, and very unexpectedly, an enormous sperm whale lept out of the water, landed on the boat, and bit off Chahab's leg.

Before the whale returned to water, Chahab, squinting through his pain, saw that the whale was wearing a name tag: "Woby Wick".

Act 1

"Call me Woby Wick".

Two years have passed since I bit of Chahab's leg.  He's been hunting me ever since.  But I can go deep down to the bottom of the lake.  Deeper than anyone knows I can go.  And don't call me a criminal!  All I did was come up for air, and it was an accident when I bit off his leg.  Remember, he was hunting me.  And his family has been hunting my kind for generations.  I was merely minding my own business, trying to live at peace.

These days, the Charlies use us whales for more things than ever.  Which means they hunt us more and more.  More than ever. I hear they make crayons out of us!  And lightbulbs and post-it-notes too!

And also, for some reason I'll never understand, they've been recording themselves say "Balk balk balk balk", and then playing the recording underwater in the lake.  It's very annoying!

And sometimes they even use the lake as a landfill.  This is our home! The Charlies must be stopped.

Since Chahab leads the whale-hunting parties, me and my comrades have vowed to get the rest of his body that I left behind.  Long live the sperm whales of Lakehouse Lake!

Act 2

"Call me Chahab".

I hunt the sperm whale Moby Wick.  The sperm whale hunters are the good guys! I'm pretty sure that the whales don't know that "balk balk balk balk" means "the sperm whale hunters are the good guys, the sperm whales are the bad guys".  But it's true.

Anyway, one time they sent up their own recording.  It sounded like a really loud whistle, then a quiet whistle, then another loud whistle, and then a quiet whistle.  Thankfully there was post-it note attached to the recording, because none of us Charlies know how to speak whale.  The post-it note said, "The sperm whales are the good guys, and the sperm whale hunters are the bad guys". But that's just wrong!
