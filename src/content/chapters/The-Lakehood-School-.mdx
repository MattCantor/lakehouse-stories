title: 'The Lakehood School '
---

The Lakehood School is the Foresthood School’s marine counterpart. Strangely, the Lakehood School is largely unheard of while the Foresthood School is the place everybody calls “the school. Wait. There’s another school?” Yet, the Lakehood School is much bigger then the Foresthood School. 

Mr. Fiyero the Frog teaches 4-6. 

Willy the Whale 

Willy the Whale is four years old. You may have heard of his dad, Woby Wick. There is a famous novel about Woby, actually. By Charles Chickens. But enough about Woby. Willy is new to the Lakehood school, and all his friends from daycare went to the Foresthood School. Willy still doesn’t understand why a turtle would go there. It simply doesn’t make any sense at all. 

Susannah the Starfish 

Susannah the Starfish is four years old. I know what you’re thinking: two four year olds in one class? If you are actually thinking that, you are a Foresthood School alumni and you need to get a lecture about point of view. Susannah is a mini scientist and the smartest in Mr. Fiyero’s class by a lot. She won the Junior Science for Animals contest three years ago. I know that she would be one three years ago. 

Buzzy the Bear 

Buzzy the Bear is five years old. He is in the Lakehood School because his dad, Bennie the Bear, really loves the lake and wanted his only child to go to school there. Obviously Buzzy doesn’t fit in that well. Buzzy’s best friend in the Lakehood School is Sid the Squid. Last year, when Sid was six and Buzzy was four, they were in the same class. 

Tilly the Tadpole 

Tilly the Tadpole is six years old. She is the oldest in her class, and definitely ready to move on to Jennifer the Jellyfish’s class with Sid the Squid and Gabby the Goldfish. Tilly has an attitude. Her best friend in the Lakehood School is Susannah the Starfish, because Susannah also has an attitude. She just hides it in science words. 

Jennifer the Jellyfish teaches 7-9 

Sid the Squid 

Sid the Squid is seven years old. He is very popular at the Lakehood School, for three reasons. One: He has the catchiest name. Two: He is the friendliest ocean animal. Three: He used to go to Foresthood School! Well, that was three years ago, when Sid was four. But STILL. Sid also has a deep, dark, secret. He has a crush on Tilly the Tadpole! Tilly absolutely does NOT like him back. 

Gabby the Goldfish 

Gabby the Goldfish is eight years old. She is Fifi the fish’s rich cousin. Gabby just moved to the lake house from a pet store, and she is loving her new life. Gabby’s favourite subject is art, or maybe Predators & Prey. Gabby never had P & P in the fishbowl! Gabby hasn’t been at the Lakehood School for very long, but she stubbornly believes it’s the best school in the world. 

Olivia the Octopus 

Olivia the Octopus is nine years old. She is a weird kid. Why? She has nine tentacles! That’s right. Nine. Olivia’s favourite subject is gym. She is the best at handstands. Her best friend is Seth the Seagull, a fellow weird kid,  and her least favourite subject is Predators and Prey. All those animals! It’s way too confusing for Olivia. She is not like Gabby the Goldfish at all. 

Seth the Seagull 

Seth the Seagull is nine years old. He cannot fly, even though he’s a SEAGULL. His favorite food is lemon. His favorite subject is History. His least favorite is Art. You cannot sculpt with wings! His favorite colour is cerulean blue. He is definitely a weird kid, just like Olivia. At home, Seth enjoys pebbleball, a game of the sea, and creating homemade aspirin. 

Tengfei the Turtle (Titi the Turtle’s dad) teaches 10-12 

Sammy the Shark 

Sammy the Shark is ten years old. He is vegetarian, even though he is a shark. He’s considered veganism once or twice, but always turned it down. He is a shark, after all. He can’t completely throw that away. Sammy enjoys karaoke, pebbleball, and field trips. According to Sid the Squid, Sammy’s soul mate goes to the Foresthood School. Her name is….Penny? 

Penina the Penguin 

Penina the Penguin is eleven years old. She is always hot, because her natural habitat is the freezing Antarctica. Even the lake house’s coldest winter is warm compared to her home! Penina has a secret. She has an imaginary friend! They are named Mimi the Mermaid and Penina thinks that Mimi is actually in her class! 

Fifi the Fish 

Fifi the Fish is twelve years old. She is a fish of many talents. Here is a shortened list: Cook, Teacher, News Reporter, Antique Furniture Collector, President (long story there), Funeral Host, Hyper Realistic Cake Baker, Buffalo (that one’s up for debate), and many, many, more. Fifi calls school a ‘gig’ and plans to leave by April. 

Mimi the Mermaid 

Mimi the Mermaid is twelve years old. She does not exist, because she is Penina’s imaginary friend. But, if she did, her favorite subject would be Swimming (one of the obvious subjects at Lakehood School) and her least favorite would be Math, because those are the ones Penina likes most and least. Whenever Mimi and Penina talk to each other, people call them crazy. Out loud. 

Craig the Crab is the principal 

Craig the Crab is the principal. He has had a long rivalry with Ralph the Raindeer, principal of the Foresthood School, and he is currently winning, with eleven (twelve if you count non-existent mermaids) students enrolled in his school, as well as a gym teacher. Craig and Ralph don’t only compete in who has a better school. They also play golf on the weekends. 

Sunny the Seal teaches Art 

Sunny the Seal is a really good art teacher. She always has two full stacks (minimum) of paper, a full barrel of pencils, and lots of pens and paint and glue and tape, and somehow none of them get wet or ruined even though the school happens in the lake. Sunny always thinks of super fun art projects for her students to try, like origami lions or a “health test for meatballs” (don’t ask). 

Olly the Orca teaches Gym 

Olly the Orca is the gym teacher. He’s a good one, too. He knows all the rules to Baseball, Basketball, Football, Dodgeball, Meatball, and Soccer. He also knows CPR and the Heimlich, if that helps. His gym class’s gym uniform doubles as a life jacket, too, and if the soccer ball turns out to be a alien in disguise, Olly has a security system in place, as well as the emergency number of Congress and the MPD.
