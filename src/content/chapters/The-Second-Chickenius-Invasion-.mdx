Act l 

One day a mad scientist chicken named Chankenstein was in his lab, working on his latest invasion. He was making a Time Machine.

 “CHANKENSTEIN!” His friend Chankenstein yelled. “WHERE’D THE FAIRY PRINCESS FRIENDSHIP FRIENDS DELUXE UNICORN LIMITED EDITION MAGICAL SURPRISE GO?” 

“I am using it for my Time Machine, Chankenstein,” Chankenstein replied. The Fairy Princess Friendship Friends Deluxe Unicorn Limited Edition Magical Surprise was a very fruity lip gloss sponsored by the TV show Fairy Princess Friendship Friends. Chankenstein found it disgusting, but nuclear waste would likely help with his Time Machine. Chankenstein, meanwhile, was utterly obsessed with it. 

“Why?” Chankenstein exclaimed, stomping down the stairs to his friend’s lab. “I understand that you are obsessed with time travel, Chankenstein-you are a mad scientist, after all-but why do you have to bring Fairy Princess Friendship Friends Deluxe Unicorn Limited Edition Magical Surprise into it? I doubt it would help your Time Machine!” 

And to prove his point, Chankenstein pressed the START button on Chankenstein’s tablet. However, the fruity lip gloss was just what Chankenstein’s invention needed, and the time machine set off to it’s default destination- 1089, (chicken years) the year that Chickenius tried to take over the Great Coop Ring for the second time.
