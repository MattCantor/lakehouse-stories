title: Emo Gets Famous
---

Dear Diary,

My name is Emo and my name means ‘emo’. Cool meaning for a name, right? My best friend is named Titi and she’s super fast.
In fact she’s so fast she beat a cheetah once! And Chennue the Cheetah was a cheetah! If you said it in an accent with soft Rs! In other words, a cheat-er! Weird, right?

Dear Diary,

Today’s lesson was so fun! Willy read us a book called How I Got Famous In A Maximum Of Eight Days! Maybe I’ll become famous! Hmm, it was written by Chennue. So maybe not?

Dear Diary,

Titi is already famous. She is famous for being a really good runner. Wally the Wolf is famous for being a fraud. Hey, so is Chennue! Maybe they should hang out!

Dear Diary, 

I’m going to give a speech tomorrow night. Chennue told me to use good words. I wonder why. Maybe he’s wishing me well? Chennue doesn’t do that.

Dear Diary, 

This is my speech! “I absolutely and wholeheartedly adore the experience of attending The Foresthood School, as it is a place where I am surrounded by an incredible number of friends who make every single day more meaningful, exciting, and memorable. The sense of community, belonging, and shared spirit there fills me with pride and happiness, and I genuinely look forward to being part of it. Even though we have a spirited and intense rivalry with The Lakehood School, I have unwavering faith in our strength, determination, and unity. I truly believe in our team, our talent, and our heart—and without a doubt, we will rise above the challenge and emerge victorious!” Fingers crossed!

Dear Diary, 

I hate Chennue! Right after my speech, she took credit for writing it! So I said, “No you didn’t Chennue!” And everyone was like, “Emo! Emo! Emo!” I thought they were cheering my name, but they were yelling at me to duck because Chennue was aiming a refrigerator at my head! I ducked, and Chennue hit an audience member. She was arrested.

Dear Diary, 

Now that everyone knows I wrote the speech, I’m famous! On Billy the Bee’s Big Words, I was awarded 200 points for it! I’m at the top of the leaderboard! 

-Emo the Emazing, and Famous Too!
