title: Emo Gets Famous
---

Dear Diary,

My name is Emo and my name means ‘emo’. Cool meaning for a name, right? My best friend is named Titi and she’s super fast. 
In fact she’s so fast she beat a cheetah once! And Chennue the Cheetah was a cheetah! If you said it in an accent with soft Rs! In other words, a cheat-er! Weird, right?

Dear Diary, 

Today’s lesson was so fun! Willy read us a book called How I Got Famous In A Maximum Of Eight Days! Maybe I’ll become famous! Hmm, it was written by Chennue. So maybe not?

Dear Diary,

Titi is already famous. She is famous for being a really good runner. Wally the Wolf is famous for being a fraud. Hey, so is Chennue! Maybe they should hang out!
