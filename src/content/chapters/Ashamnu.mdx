title: Ashamnu
synopsis: The animals observe the high holidays
---

It was that time of year again.  Summer had turned to fall, and Wally was grumpy and irritable. Soon it would be Yom Kippur, and that meant Wally would be fasting.  All day.  No food at all.  Wally didn’t like to fast.

There was only one good thing about Yom Kippur, in Wally’s view, and that was break fast.  Wally always preferred to break his fast with a small glass or orange juice, and some delicious, freshly stolen Charlie.

Services this year were being in Mr. Finnigan’s backyard.  The usual congregants would be there.  Frodo the Fox and the rest of the fox family, Bennie the Bear, and others.  Wally had heard that this year there would be a kinder minyan for Dolly the Deer, Fiona the Fox, Penny the Porcupine, Emo the Ostrich, and the other young forest animals, led by Bennie the Bear.

Not great. Because it meant that Wally would have a tough time getting to Mr. Finnigan’s chicken coop with all those animals around.  He’d have an easier time if he could somehow get into that service.  But why would Mr. Finnigan let him in?  He’d have to come up with a plan.

Wally paid a visit to Bennie the Bear.  Bennie had just finished his morning swim.

”Pleasure to see you Wally,” said Bennie.  “To what do I owe this pleasure?”

“Oh, I was just thinking ahead to the haggim.  And I was wondering if you might let me accompany you to Mr. Finnigan’s services this year. It would be nice to spend some time together.”

Bennie was suspicious.  Of course he knew that Wally was up to something.  Wally was always up to something.

”Sure, that would be swell,” said Bennie. “I was actually just in the middle of preparing my materials for the kinder minyan I’ll be leading.”

Wally had no interest in Bennie’s programming.  He couldn’t really care less about it, in fact.  He tried to excuse himself, but Bennie wasn’t having it.

”Come, take a look”.  Bennie opened up his notebook and started to explain to Wally what he was working on. “I think this one might have some meaning to you.”  Bennie read to Wally to the following prayer, lightly tapping Wally’s chest with east stanza.

Wally understood exactly what he had to do.  “I see all the ways I need to repent.  Can I lead this portion of the service?”

“Yes you may my friend. I think that would be lovely.

“By the way, where were you thinking of having your break fast this year, Bennie?”

“Oh you know me, I always like to head down to the garbage dump for my break fast.  But I heard that the rest of the congregation will be breaking fast in the amphitheater.  Will you plan to go?”

### Act II

Wally put on a truly spectacular performance.  He sang Ashamnu with emotion and candor.  He gave eloquent summary of each of his sins, trying them back to his own transgressions as well as those of the community’s at large.  He saw that Bennie the Bear was nodding solemnly, and that Rachel the Rabbit was visibly moved.  The children hung on his every word.

Wally didn’t really believe a word of it.  Wally was after all still a wolf, and as a wolf he had no capacity to repent.

When the services had concluded and the animals started down the path towards the amphitheater to break their fast, Wally raided the chicken coop.
