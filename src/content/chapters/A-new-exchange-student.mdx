---

### Act 1

A new student is coming to the foresthood school!

The student is coming all the way from Antartica, as foreign exchange student.  They'll be coming to Rachel the Rabbit's class, and staying from fall to spring.

All of the forest animals are very excited.  They don't know much about Antarctica, other than that it's cold.  They don't know anything the student, not even what kind of animal he is.  All that Rachel told them was that it's the biggest land animal in Antartica. So they figured he must be huge!

The only animal in the school who isn't very excited to meet the new foreign exchange student is Polly the Polar Bear.  Polly likes being the biggest animal from far far away. It makes him feel special.  But now there's going to be a new animal in the forest, also from far far away, and also big like Polly?  This cannot stand!
