title: 'A History of Us: a play'
---

Mr. Finnigan was going to a play. It was called "A History of Us". The playwright said they were making history in theater.  This was because there were animals performing in this play. Young animals, ages 4 to 12! There was only one human in the entire play. The mayor, Wally the Wolf, was also performing in the play.

When Mr. Finnigan arrived at the playhouse, he saw signs saying "Making history! A History of Us: a play".  Mr. Finnigan had decided to come to see this play because he liked history.  He hadn't heard exactly what the play was about, but he was curious to find out.

When the play started, the set was a long piece of cardboard, cut out to look like the waves of the sea. Emo the Ostrich, dressed up as Eostipher Olumbus, was looking through a cardboard telescope. Henry the Hippo, Elli the Elephant, and Gigi the Giraffe were all dressed as the crew on the Santa Maria. It was clear that behind the waves all of the actors had their legs underneath a cardboard ship. They all walked together onto the set. They crossed the set, then returned backstage.

The lights went dark.

When they lit up again, Mr. Finnigan could see Fiona the Fox dressed as Queen Fizzabella, the Queen of Spain. In front of her were Wally the Wolf and Jefe the Manager, dressed as palace guards. Eostopher Olumbus entered the room. Behind him were the crew of the Santa Maria. Queen Fizzabella addressed Eostopher. "Hello, thank you for coming. I understand that you intend to travel to India by sailing west?"
