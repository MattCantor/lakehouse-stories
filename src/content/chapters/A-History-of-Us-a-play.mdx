title: 'A History of Us: a play'
---

Mr. Finnigan was going to a play. It was called "A History of Us". The playwright said they were making history in theater.  This was because there were animals performing in this play. Young animals, ages 4 to 12! There was only one human in the entire play. The mayor, Wally the Wolf, was also performing in the play.

When Mr. Finnigan arrived at the playhouse, he saw signs saying "Making history! A History of Us: a play".  Mr. Finnigan had decided to come to see this play because he liked history.  He hadn't heard exactly what the play was about, but he was curious to find out.

When the play started, the set was a long piece of cardboard, cut out to look like the waves of the sea. Emo the Ostrich, dressed up as Eostopher Olumbus, was looking through a cardboard telescope. Henry the Hippo, Elli the Elephant, and Gigi the Giraffe were all dressed as the crew on the Santa Maria. It was clear that behind the waves all of the actors had their legs underneath a cardboard ship. They all walked together onto the set. They crossed the set, then returned backstage.

The lights went dark.

When they lit up again, Mr. Finnigan could see Fiona the Fox dressed as Queen Fizzabella, the Queen of Spain. In front of her were Wally the Wolf and Jefe the Manager, dressed as palace guards. Eostopher Olumbus entered the room. Behind him were the crew of the Santa Maria. Queen Fizzabella addressed Eostopher. "Hello, thank you for coming. I understand that you intend to travel to India by sailing west?"

"Yes", said Eostopher. "The distance between India and Spain when you are sailing west is roughly 19,884 miles. However, the distance between Spain and North America, where Eostopher Olumbus ended up going, is approximately 3,604 miles."

Queen Fizzabella was visibly frustrated and annoyed that Emo had broken character and spoiled the whole play (again, just like in rehearsals). Mr. Finnigan saw the theater go dark before the next scene began. It showed Eostopher, Henry, Elli, and Gigi back in the cardboard ship, behind the cardboard-cutout-waves. It was basically the same scene from before. Once that scene ended and the theater went dark, Mr. Finnigan heard Fiona yelling at Emo. "Why do you spoil it every single time?".

"What does the word 'spoil' mean?" asked Emo. "Could you kindly elucidate the semantic content and connotations associated with this term? I seek to comprehend its varied implications and potential uses within the English lexicon."

There was silence.

In the next scene, Gigi, Eostopher, Henry, and Elli arrived in North America. Clem the Chameleon was picking Edelweiss off of a tree and Dolly the Deer was fishing. But the moment that Dolly saw a gigantic crowd of people staring at her (especially Mr. Finnigan), she jumped off the stage and ran out of the theater! Right after Dolly ran out of the theater, Clem got bored and blended into the set.  The audience reacted like it was a magic show!

Penny the Porcupine then walked on stage, dressed in her school clothes, holding a permission slip from her mother.  "I'm here for the field trip!", she screamed.

Fiona sighed loudly from offstage.  "Get back here, Penny, this isn't a field trip!", she stage whispered.

"Ugh," said Penny, "when are we going to get to go on a field trip?!?"

While all of this was going on, Henry had eaten all of the Edelweiss on the stage. He started to look a bit green, and then threw up on Clem. A lot. Clem was understandably very upset, and started running in circles around the stage.  The crowd was both appalled and amazed, as Clem looked like a green ghost who was waving his arms around the set.

Gigi tried to help clean up the vomit that was all over the stage at this point.  But there was so much of it that Gigi slipped and starting swimming around in it more than cleaning.

Elli, thinking quickly, filled her trunk with water (which elephants do in the wild) and sprayed it on the stage in an effort to help clean up the Henry's vomit.  This only made things worse, as being so forgetful, she directed her trunk at the audience instead of the floor.  The folks in the first few rows got drenched.

Fiona ran to the audience with towels, with a hoof over her eyes in shame and shaking her head in disgust. Many of them were already heading for the exits.

All of the actors who had not thrown up, swam in vomit, turned invisible, or sprayed the audience with water we slipping around on the vomit soaked stage like they were ice skating. The audience members who had not left assuming this was all still part of this (really weird and historic) magic show!

“Okay, okay!” Yelled Fiona. “Sorry about all this, everyone! But I think you all know Eostopher basically arrived in America, so we can continue.” The stage went dark once more. Then there were sounds of people scrubbing the stage. When the theater turned light again, Emo suddenly looked scared. “This is my first time acting!” She yelled. “I’m gonna get eaten by a eagle like the managers son!” She started running around and waving her arms in the air. “What?” Said the manager, running from backstage. “My son is in the audience-look!” Everyone looked at the managers son, who was frowning up at the stage. “THE MANAGERS SON CAME BACK FROM THE DEAD!” Screamed Emo.      

“The only ghost here is that green one, see?” Replied someone in the audience, because Clem was still invisible and covered in vomit. “Clem’s not a-oh, never mind!” Fiona muttered from backstage, but Clem was waving his arms in the air and screaming “I died and came back from the dead! When did I die? People, do you know when I died?!” He and Emo bumped into each other. “Ahhh! A ghost bumped into me!” Emo screamed at the same time Clem screamed “Ahhh! The ghost of Eostopher Olumbus bumped into me!” Then the people in the audience that were still there got confused.

“I thought the Eostopher Olumbus guy was an actor!” Someone yelled. “Two ghosts in one place during one performance? How’d that happen?” Screamed another. “This shouldn’t be called a playhouse, it should be called a ghosthouse!” Announced a third person. “The ghosthouse really is a good name for a theater that only does performances about supernatural beings,” remarked another. “You’re wrong!” Exclaimed someone else. “There are three ghosts: the weird green one, Eostopher Olumbus, and the managers son!” Fiona ran from backstage. “This place isn’t called the ghosthouse!” She screamed. It’s called the Port Jervis
