title: Ancient Egypt According to the Forest Animals

### Act 1 : 1,212 B.C.

Femi the Fox was the ancient ancestor of Frido and the rest of the Fox family.  She was a tomb robber.  Back in her day, that meant stealing chickens from chicken coops, which back then were shaped as pyramids. The biggest pyramid-shaped chicken coop back then was owned by Farough Finnigan, and was referred to by everyone as "The Great Pyramid of Chiza" (since it housed chickens).

Kheti the Chicken was the only dead chicken at the moment, and her fellow chickens hadn't yet buried her outside because they didn't want to give the wolves and the foxes and the other tomb robbers a free meal.

Instead, they placed her into a locked sarcophagus and hid it deep the Great Pyramid of Chiza.  But they didn't think that maybe Femi would take it home and scratch it open with her claws, just she does with the other stuff she finds in the pyramid.
