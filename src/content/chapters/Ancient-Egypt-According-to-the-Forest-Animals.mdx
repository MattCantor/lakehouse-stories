title: Ancient Egypt According to the Forest Animals

### Act 1 : 1,212 B.C.

Femi the Fox was the ancient ancestor of Frido and the rest of the Fox family.  She was a tomb robber.  Back in her day, that meant stealing chickens from chicken coops, which back then were shaped as pyramids. The biggest pyramid-shaped chicken coop back then was owned by Farough Finnigan, and was referred to by everyone as "The Great Pyramid of Chiza" (since it housed chickens).

Kheti the Chicken was the only dead chicken at the moment, and her fellow chickens hadn't yet buried her outside because they didn't want to give the wolves and the foxes and the other tomb robbers a free meal.

Instead, they placed her into a locked, golden charcophagus (a sarcophagus for chickens) and hid it deep the Great Pyramid of Chiza.  But they didn't think that maybe Femi would take it home and scratch it open with her claws, just she does with the other stuff she finds in the pyramid.

Right now Femi was trying to unlock the charcophagus from the inside of the pyramid. She threw a coin right onto it. Immediately one of the chickens opened the charcophagus to put the coin inside, because it was precious.  This was Femi's chance. She dove inside the pyramid and grabbed the charcophagus.  Then ran away as fast as she could with grabbing the other chicken, who had opened it. Femi didn't take the coin with her either.

Pretty soon a rumor was circulating about the The Great Pyramid of Chiza. The coin was cursed, and anyone who touched it would immediately become lunch for the foxes! Because of the coin, the chickens had lost their beloved Kheti and their special, golden charcophagus.

### Act 2: 1,090 B.C. (122 years later)

Khentaus the Chicken stared at the small coin in his hand. He had heard old stories about a cursed coin that looked very similar. The story involved his great great grandmother, allegedly, and how this cursed coin had led to her remains being desecrated by a tomb robber fox. Now that tomb robber's great great grandson was still stealing chickens, continuing the his family's way of life. His name was Fenuku the Fox.

Fenuku was actually planning an attack on The Great Pyramid of Chiza right now. He stole Khentaus and the foxes brought him home. Now the foxes were splitting the chickens they caught into two groups:  the portions that they keep, and the portions that they sell. So Khentaus was sorted in the portion that they sell. 

Bomani the Bear bought Khentaus for two figures of cursed coins. The foxes were interested in the figurines so they could try to make more cursed coins, which they thought would bring them more chickens.  Bomani wanted to use Khentaus a model for new kind of figurine he was experimenting with.

But after Bomani made the model, he didn't know what to do with Khentaus. Could he give Khentaus back to the foxes? No, that probably wouldn't work, then he would have given the foxes those cursed coin figurines for nothing. Could he throw Khentaus in the Nile? No, then his favorite place to wash off his figurines after they've dried would be covered in chicken stuff.

So he did the only other thing he could think of. He set Khentaus free!

### Act 3: 1,089 (1 year later)

Khentaus was thinking of what his friend Khafra the Chicken had said. Khentaus found out after he was set free that Khafra had been bought by Farough Finnigan at the market shortly after Khentaus had been chickenapped. Khentaus had deposited the cursed coin into Farough Finnigan's wallet and, according to Khafra, she had been bought using that same coin. "I'm pretty sure all of that guy's chickens are gong to be lunch for the foxes!" she had said.
