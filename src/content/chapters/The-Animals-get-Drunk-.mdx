Act l 

Ms Rachel’s class was ahead of the curriculum. They had finished the mammals section of Predators and Prey and school had only been open for a month! So, Ms Rachel was taking a one-week break to study a word she pulled out of the dictionary, and this particular day it was ‘ALCOHOL.” 

Meanwhile Wally was listening in. He had been kind of bored lately. He hadn’t stolen a chicken for awhile, and Port Jervis was running smoothly so he didn’t have much to do as mayor. 

So why not listen in on a bunch of 7-9 year olds as they did their learning? 

“Humans did not invent alcohol,” Ms Rachel was saying when he arrived.
