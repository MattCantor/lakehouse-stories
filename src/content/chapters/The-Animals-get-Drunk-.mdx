Act l 

Ms Rachel’s class was ahead of the curriculum. They had finished the mammals section of Predators and Prey and school had only been open for a month! So, Ms Rachel was taking a one-week break to study a word she pulled out of the dictionary, and this particular day it was ‘ALCOHOL.” 

Meanwhile Wally was listening in. He had been kind of bored lately. He hadn’t stolen a chicken for awhile, and Port Jervis was running smoothly so he didn’t have much to do as mayor. 

So why not listen in on a bunch of 7-9 year olds as they did their learning? 

“Humans did not invent alcohol,” Ms Rachel was saying when he arrived. “It’s a nature thing. They just copied how it worked.” 

Suddenly Wally had an amazing idea. 

Act ll 

LIVE FROM THE BALKY DEBATES!!

Charlotte: Hi, I’m Charlotte the Chicken, live at the Balky Debates! This year the final debate is who has stolen more chickens. Chuck says Wally, but Charlie says Frido. Let’s listen in! 

Charlie: See these FOX FURS around our entrance? They outnumber the wolf ones! 

(Audience Member): Foxes shed-so what? 

Chuck: Wait-some furs could be Felix! Charlie, you are counting Frido alone! If you split the fox furs in half, I’d bet the wolf ones outnumber each part!
