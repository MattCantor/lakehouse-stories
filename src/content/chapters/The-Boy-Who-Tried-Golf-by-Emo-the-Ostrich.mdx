title: 'The Boy Who Tried Golf, by Emo the Ostrich'
synopsis: Trying new things is dangerous
---

On a Saturday morning towards the end of fall, Emo and Wally made their way to the mine for the morning shift.  As usual, Emo joined the other laborers while Wally headed off to the Manager's office to chew the fat.

Emo got right to work, swinging her hammer with abandon against the rocks.  Bang! Bang! Bang!

Wally found the Manager at his desk within the cave.

"HOW ARE YOU DOING JEFE", Wally screamed over Emo's banging.

The Manager was always delighted to see Wally.  Everyone loved Wally.

Wally and the Manager exchanged small talk for a while, while Emo listened in.  Wally asked the Manager about his weekend, and the Manager's face brightened.

"We've been trying to get my older boy interested in some new hobbies.  So I brought him to the country club, so we could play his first round of 18.  The kid has a knack for golf.  He got an eagle on the fourteenth hole!

Emo could tell that Wally is shocked by this news, although she can't quite make out exactly what Wally is saying because Emo is continuing to swing her hammer and make a ruckus.  But Emo understands that Wally is clearly upset.  An eagle ate the Manager's son, all because he tried golf!
