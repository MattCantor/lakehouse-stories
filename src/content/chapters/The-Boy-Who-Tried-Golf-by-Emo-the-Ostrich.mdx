synopsis: Trying new things is dangerous
---

On a Saturday morning towards the end of fall, Emo and Wally made their way to the mine for the morning shift.  As usual, Emo joined the other laborers while Wally headed off to the Manager's office to chew the fat.

Emo got right to work, swinging her hammer with abandon against the rocks.  Bang! Bang! Bang!

Wally found the Manager at his desk within the cave.

"HOW ARE YOU DOING JEFE", Wally screamed over Emo's banging.

The Manager was always delighted to see Wally.  Everyone loved Wally.

Wally and the Manager exchanged small talk for a while, while Emo listened in.  Wally asked the Manager about his weekend, and the Manager's face brightened.

"We've been trying to get my older boy interested in some new hobbies.  So I brought him to the country club, so we could play his first round of 18.  The kid has a knack for golf.  He got an eagle on the fourteenth hole!

Emo could tell that Wally is shocked by this news, although she can't quite make out exactly what Wally is saying because Emo is continuing to swing her hammer and make a ruckus.  But Emo understands that Wally is clearly upset.  An eagle ate the Manager's son, all because he tried golf!

Emo was distraught from this news all day.  When she went home that afternoon she went straight to her journal to process her feelings.  She ended up writing a little story for herself, so she'd never forget this important lesson

**Chapter 1**

Once upon a time a boy went to try golf with his father, the Manager. The boy was doing great in the first 13 holes.  He got every ball in the hole and was clearly going to be a great golf player.  But on the 14th hole, an eagle swooped down from the trees and stole his golf club.

The boy loved his golf club and didn't want the eagle to steal it.  So he held on tight, and was soon hurtling through the sky as the eagle flew away.

Chapter 2

As the eagle soared the sky, the air was filled with the chirps of baby eagles. All the baby eagles though that the boy was worm, and some of the mother eagles did too.

The first baby eagle to reach the boy tried to peck at his legs. All of the other eagles tried to do the same thing.

Chapter 3

Before long the eagles had eaten the boy entirely.  Only his golf club was left, still hanging in the eagle's claws.

Never try new things.  Trying new things can get you eaten!
