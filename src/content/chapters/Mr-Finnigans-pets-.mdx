title: 'Mr. Finnigan’s pets '
---

Act 1

One day, Wally the wolf was sitting at his desk, very hungry. Lately, he had grown extremely sick of Mr finnigans Charlies. He had ordered McDonald’s but could only afford 2 chicken nuggets. He simply did not have the money. If only he could get        More money… suddenly, Fifi the fish came wheeling into his office in her mobile fish tank. “Wally. Wally Wally Wally…YOU OWE ME!!!!”

“What do you want, Fifi?”

“Well, see, back in the lake, i had an enemy named Fredrick the fish. AND HE HOGS ALL THE FOOD AND NOW MR FINNIGAN ADOPTED HIM AND HE GETS ALL THE FOOD HE WANTS AND HE HAS A BEATIFUL TANKMATE NAMED SNOOPY THE SNAIL AND I THOUGHT ABOUT DATING HIM BUT NOW I CANT BEACAUSE HE IS FREDRICKS TANKMATE-” Wally was surprised. “Fifi, CALM DOWN, will you?!?”

“Sorry,sorry, haven’t had my coffee.” Fifi took a sip of Wally’s coffee that was sitting at his desk. “Anyway, can you help?” Wally decided the best way to do this was to simply eat Fredrick, ask for payment (beacause he was mayor and could arrest anyone he wanted to), and go on with life, fully paid.

Act 2

When Wally knocked on Mr Finnigan’s door as part of his plan, he was greeted by Mrs Finnigan, and asked to see there new pet. “Why, of course!” She answered. Wally was very happy, because this meant he didn't have to trick Mr Finnigan into letting him in. Actually, Mrs Finnigan was Wally’s biggest fan. 

When Fredrick the fish saw Wally, 3 scenarios played in his head. 

1: hide behind the love of his life, snoopy the snail 

2: pretend to be helpless

3: go back to sleeping because it probably had nothing to do with him

Act 3

Fredrick chose option three. and got eaten. Let’s just say Mrs Finnigan is not Wally’s biggest fan anymore. 

Fifi was happy. Wally wasn’t, because he was covered in bones, meat, leaves, and other signs of struggle to get away from Mrs Finnigan. “Somehow,” Wally sighed, “I’m not as bored of chicken anymore.”
