Act 1

It was a time of darkness and despair for the chickens. 

It had been RAINING every day that week. The charlies were sick of it. 

They never liked rain, ever, anyway. 

Charlie hated it the most. He hated how it made his nest messy, uncomfortable, and cold. He hated the annoying sound it made. 

After two weeks of rain, Charlie and some other rain-haters boarded up the top of the coop. The water stopped flowing in. Everyone was happy.
