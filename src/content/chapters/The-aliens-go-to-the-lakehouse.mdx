Act 1

It was a time of darkness and despair for the chickens.

It had been RAINING every day that week. The charlies were sick of it.

They never liked rain, ever, anyway.

Charlie hated it the most. He hated how it made his nest messy, uncomfortable, and cold. He hated the annoying sound it made.

After two weeks of rain, Charlie and some other rain-haters boarded up the top of the coop. The water stopped flowing in. Everyone was happy. 

Wally was going to steal some chickens because Wally does that stuff. He discovered that the chickens had solved their own problem!

This made Wally very grumpy because now the chickens must be getting smart. Would they become harder to catch and eat and stuff? 

Then he had a really awesome idea of how to catch himself a Charlie or two.
