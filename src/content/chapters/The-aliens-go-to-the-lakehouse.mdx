Act 1

It was a time of darkness and despair for the chickens.

It had been RAINING every day that week. The charlies were sick of it.

They never liked rain, ever, anyway.

Charlie hated it the most. He hated how it made his nest messy, uncomfortable, and cold. He hated the annoying sound it made.

After two weeks of rain, Charlie and some other rain-haters boarded up the top of the coop. The water stopped flowing in. Everyone was happy.

Wally was going to steal some chickens because Wally does that stuff. He discovered that the chickens had solved their own problem!

This made Wally very grumpy because now the chickens must be getting smart. Would they become harder to catch and eat and stuff?

Then he had a really awesome idea of how to catch himself a Charlie or two.

Act 2

Fiona the Fox, Dolly the Deer, and Penny the Porcupine were walking home from school when they saw the mayor, Wally the Wolf.

“Hi Wally,” all three girls said together kind of eerily.

“Did you know that the Charlies have been taken over by chickaliens?”

“Don’t be silly Wally. There’s no such thing as chickaliens.”

“UH-HUH. You know I have been to planet Balk-Balk in the Chickus galaxy and I met them myself!” 

“Really?” 

“Fiona, I never lie. I swear on chicken dinners, which I never eat, and the soul of Charlie Chicken, who I did not kill..” 

“Hmm that’s very convincing come on Dolly and Penny let’s go check.”

“Wow that was easy!”

Act 3

Dolly, Penny, and Fiona prepared the exorcism. Technically chickaliens weren’t evil spirits but EH, potato potato, tomato tomato. For this very important event Dolly, Fiona and Penny dressed in black robes with white crosses on them that they got at Trader Joe’s. They dragged out a couple of chickens. 

“WE MUST CLOSE OUR EYES AND SAY THE CHANT TO ABSORB THE EVIL MAGIC: EEKA VOO!” 

They began to chant Eeka Voo, which Wally had taught them. “EEKA VOO DA DA SAMA SAMA EEKA LARO VOO VOO! EEKA VOO DA DA SAMA SAMA EEKA LARO VOO VOO!” 

But the chickens disappeared!

“IT’S CHICKALIEN MAGIC!” Dolly screeched. Then she ran away.

Elsewhere, Wally ate his delicious Charlie. “Mm,” he said.
