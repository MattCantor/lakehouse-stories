title: Dolly the Deer plays hide and seek
synopsis: Dolly knows all the good places to hide
---

Dolly the Deer was scared of everyone, other than her friends Penny the Porcupine, Fiona the Fox, and her parents.
Whenever she saw Mr. Finnigan, she would run away and hide behind a tree.
Some of the boys at school would tease her, and say she was playing hide and seek.
Dolly was actually really good at hide and seek for this reason!

One day, Fiona asked to play hide and seek with Dolly. "Sure," said Dolly.

Fiona said, "can you be the seeker this time?"

"Ok", said Dolly.

Fiona went off to hide, while Dolly closed her eyes and counted to 20.

Since Dolly spent so much time hiding, she knew all the good hiding spots, and was a pretty good seeker.
But very shortly after Dolly started looking for Fiona, Dolly saw Mr. Finnigan walking through the woods.
Dolly quickly ran off to hide.
She went to her best, super secret, impossible to find hiding spot.

There was Fiona!

"You found me!"", Fiona said.

Fiona didn't know that Dolly had just been trying to hide from Mr. Finnigan herself.

Dolly said, "I guess it's time for us to go to school."

So Dolly and Fiona went to school together.
