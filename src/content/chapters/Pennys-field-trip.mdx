title: Penny’s field trip
---

Principal Ralph was fed up with Penny the porcupine ALWAYS ASKING for field trips, so one day he decided to grant her request.

Penny was very excited about this. “Then you got the Time Machine so we can go to Ancient Egypt? Oh! You got the airplane so we can go to the amazon rainforest? THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE!!!” 

“We’re going to the mining place down the street,” Ralph replied. 

There was an illness going around the forest. One week Emo was sick, and the next Fiona was out, and then two weeks later they were both back and no one showed up to Huck’s class. 

Penny didn’t pay much attention to this. She was too busy daydreaming about going to San Fransisco in a school bus. 

But soon Penny woke up coughing, and her mother phoned the school, saying Penny couldn’t go to school.

That was the day of the field trip.
