title: Next year at the Foresthood School
---

Act 1

It was the last day of school. All the Foresthood School animals were happy.

Emo had asked the principal if she could drive a school bus to the Foresthood School many times that year, but he kept forgetting to respond. Then, that last day, he gave her permission to drive there.Hum

Emo was a terrible driver. She drove the school bus into the lake. Sadly, everyone in the school had decided to take the bus.

So everyone was a two hours late. But no one was that mad at Emo. She was a pretty likable ostrich.

Act 2

In Willy the warthog’s class, the first thing they did was take attendance. Everyone was there.

“Okay, people we will be having a spelling test. Use a stick to scratch ‘table’ into the dirt.”

“Scratch ‘hello.’ Okay the test is over.”

“The charcophagus holding Kheti the chicken was stolen in 1,212 BC!” Screamed Emo.

“Um, okay, Emo,” said Willy the warthog. Anyway, we have 1 free period before lunch, yes you arrived two hours late.” 

Act 3

In Rachel the rabbits class, Dolly was absent, because she was too scared to go to school after Mr. Finnigan accidentally fished the school bus out of the lake. 

Penny and Fiona learned that mosquitos sucked human blood and were therefore predetors to humans in Predetors & Prey. And then they learned humans are very silly animals. 

And they learned about famous mosquitos. And famous mosquito empires. And the history of mosquitos. And they wrote halloween stories about mosquito vampires. 

And they wrote reports on mosquitos. 

Then they had a test on mosquitos. That is how Rachel the rabbit teaches her students. 

“Okay, lunchtime, everyone,” she said.
