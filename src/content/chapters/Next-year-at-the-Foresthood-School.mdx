title: Next year at the Foresthood School
---

Act 1

It was the last day of school. All the Foresthood School animals were happy.

Emo had asked the principal if she could drive a school bus to the Foresthood School many times that year, but he kept forgetting to respond. Then, that last day, he gave her permission to drive there.

Emo was a terrible driver. She drove the school bus into the lake. Sadly, everyone in the school had decided to take the bus. Luckily, Mr. Finnigan fished the bus out of the lake.

So everyone was two hours late. But no one was that mad at Emo. She was a pretty likable ostrich.

Act 2

In Willy the warthog’s class, the first thing they did was take attendance. Everyone was there.

“Okay, people, we will be having a spelling test. Use a stick to scratch ‘table’ into the dirt.”

“Scratch ‘hello.’ Okay the test is over.”

“The charcophagus holding Kheti the chicken was stolen in 1,212 BC!” Screamed Emo.

“Um, okay, Emo,” said Willy the warthog. Anyway, we have one free period before lunch, yes you arrived that late!”

Act 3

In Rachel the rabbits class, Dolly was absent, because she was too scared to go to school after Mr. Finnigan accidentally fished the school bus out of the lake.

Penny and Fiona learned that mosquitos sucked human blood and were therefore predetors to humans in Predators & Prey. And then they learned humans are very silly animals.

And they learned about famous mosquitos. And famous mosquito empires. And the history of mosquitos. And they wrote halloween stories about mosquito vampires.

And they wrote reports on mosquitos.

Then they had a test on mosquitos.

“Okay, lunchtime, everyone,” Rachel said.

Act 4

Elli the elephant, Gigi the giraffe, and Henry the hippo were in Lee the lizard’s art class.

“Everybody, today we will carve these wood logs. A thank you for Fiona the fox, who carved out carving materials with her claws. This is how you carve: slice this way, slice that way, stab here, stab there. Go! We have an hour and thirty minutes to do this.”

Gigi made a pair of stilts. After she finished carving them, she practiced using them. She was very satisfied.

Henry made his wheelbarrow bigger. “The more (lunch) the merrier” was his motto, anyway.

Elli made herself, as a lion, with five heads, dressed as a pirate in pink underpants. Elli had forgotten what she looked like.

Act 5

It was lunchtime. Everyone was yelling about many different things.

“Mosquitos suck the blood of humans!”

“You spell table T-A-B-L-E! We learned that!”

“Which of my heads is the most flattering?”

“With my stilts, I will never be short again-OW! I fell off of them!”

“Ancient mosquitos are very, very interesting! I recommend reading about them!”

“Human beings are silly.”

“COME ON, winter vacation! Three months of no school!  I cannot wait!”

“Mega-wheelbarrow for-EVER! Anyone want free grass? Hey, Emo, you’re trampling my favorite grazing spot!”

“The lake is AWESOME for swimming this time of year, don’t you think?”

Act 6

In Willy the warthog’s class, Willy told everyone that they were supposed to write rhyming poems. “About whether or not you are hibernating,” he told them.

Emo’s poem was:

i dont hav a dog                                                                                                                                                                            my meels are nat big                                                                                                                                                                and i dont hibernat                                                                                                                                                                        and also i like twigs 

Emo the ostrich is not the best speller.

Titi’s poem was:

I DU NOT REMEMBR                                                                                                                                                                 IF I HYBRNAT                                                                                                                                                                             BUT MOMMY SES DAT IT SNOWS IN WINTR WHAT IS SNOW AGAIN                                                                                                                  OLSO TEECHR WUT IS RYMING

Titi does not know what rhyming is.

Clem’s poem was:

Seriously, it does not matter if I hibernate!                                                                                                                                 Next year I will be in Rachel the rabbit’s class!                                                                                                                          You get brain freeze if you eat ice cream too fast.                                                                                                                  Okay Willy I am bored of writing this poem.

I think Clem is the best at writing in the class. And he forgot to rhyme.

Act 7

Fiona and Penny had another Predators & Prey lesson.

They learned about polar bears. They learned polar bears eat seals and fish. And they made pretend interviews between themselves and the polar bears. 

WHAT I WOULD ASK A POLAR BEAR by Fiona The Fox.                                                                                                                 What is your name?                                                                                                                                                                                Pana.                                                                                                                                                                                    What is the place that you live called?                                                                                                                                       The great big iceberg.                                                                                                                                                                  Is it a just an iceberg that nobody leaves, or is it one iceberg in a colony of icebergs that people often travel between?           A whole lot of icebergs. I like this one. Fish come here a LOT. 

MY POLAR BEAR INTERVIEW BY PENNY THE PORCUPINE! WHO IS ME!                                                                                                                        Do you like field trips?                                                                                                                                                              They are the best thing in the world.                                                                                                                                               What is the best field trip you ever had?                                                                                                                                    Two years ago we went to Snow Land. It’s an amusement park.                                                                                                   We have not yet had a field trip at my school. All five years I have been here. Do you think that is a terrible crime?                Completely!       

Act 8         

Gigi the giraffe was in the nurses office after falling off her stilts. Henry and Elli learned about the history of snow. 

“THIS YEARS snow,” Huck the hyena reminded them for the forty-fifth time. “In spring last years snow melted. In summer all that stuff was just GONE. And now it’s there again. Snow is a weather thing. The End!”
