title: Next year at the Foresthood School
---

Act 1

It was the last day of school. All the Foresthood School animals were happy.

Emo had asked the principal if she could drive a school bus to the Foresthood School many times that year, but he kept forgetting to respond. Then, that last day, he gave her permission to drive there.

Emo was a terrible driver. She drove the school bus into the lake. Sadly, everyone in the school had decided to take the bus. Luckily, Mr. Finnigan fished the bus out of the lake. 

So everyone was two hours late. But no one was that mad at Emo. She was a pretty likable ostrich.

Act 2

In Willy the warthog’s class, the first thing they did was take attendance. Everyone was there.

“Okay, people, we will be having a spelling test. Use a stick to scratch ‘table’ into the dirt.”

“Scratch ‘hello.’ Okay the test is over.”

“The charcophagus holding Kheti the chicken was stolen in 1,212 BC!” Screamed Emo.

“Um, okay, Emo,” said Willy the warthog. Anyway, we have one free period before lunch, yes you arrived that late!” 

Act 3

In Rachel the rabbits class, Dolly was absent, because she was too scared to go to school after Mr. Finnigan accidentally fished the school bus out of the lake. 

Penny and Fiona learned that mosquitos sucked human blood and were therefore predetors to humans in Predetors & Prey. And then they learned humans are very silly animals. 

And they learned about famous mosquitos. And famous mosquito empires. And the history of mosquitos. And they wrote halloween stories about mosquito vampires. 

And they wrote reports on mosquitos.

Then they had a test on mosquitos. 

“Okay, lunchtime, everyone,” Rachel said. 

Act 4

Elli the elephant, Gigi the giraffe, and Henry the hippo were in Lee the lizard’s art class. 

“Everybody, today we will carve these wood logs. A thank you for Fiona the fox, who carved out carving materials with her claws. This is how you carve: slice this way, slice that way, stab here, stab there. Go! We have an hour and thirty minutes to do this.” 

Gigi made a pair of stilts. After she finished carving them, she practiced using them. She was very satisfied. 

Henry made his wheelbarrow bigger. “The more (lunch) the merrier” was his motto, anyway.

Elli made herself, as a lion, with five heads, dressed as a pirate in pink underpants. Elli had forgotten what she looked like.
