title: Next year at the Foresthood School
---

Act 1

It was the last day of school. All the Foresthood School animals were happy.

Emo had asked the principal if she could drive a school bus to the Foresthood School many times that year, but he kept forgetting to respond. Then, that last day, he gave her permission to drive there.

Emo was a terrible driver. She drove the school bus into the lake. Sadly, everyone in the school had decided to take the bus.

So everyone was an hour late. But no one was that mad at Emo. She was a pretty likable ostrich.

Act 2

In Willy the warthog’s class, the first thing they did was take attendance. Everyone was there.

“Okay, people we will be having a spelling test. Use a stick to scratch ‘table’ into the dirt.”

“Scratch ‘hello.’ Okay the test is over.”

“The charphogus holding was stolen in 1,212 BC!” Screamed Emo.
