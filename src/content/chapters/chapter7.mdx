title: "Frido the Fox saved from drowning by Bennie the Bear"
synopsis: "Bennie the Bear comes to the rescue."
---

Wally the Wolf was walking through the woods one day.
He saw Mr. Finnigan setting a trap for Frido the Fox.
Wally was concerned.
Wally needs Frido to be free, so that Wally can blame Frido for stealing Mr. Finnigan's chickens.
Then Wally thought of Frido's son, Felix the Fox.
But still, it would be great if there were two foxes around to blame, instead of one.
If there were only one around, then maybe folks would start to wonder whether Wally was working with the other fox to steal the chickens.
That would not be good! Maybe Wally could blame chicken stealing on Fiona the Fox.
Might be a tough sell, since she's only 10 years old.

The trap sprung while Frido was walking by.
He jumped to the side to avoid the trap, and didn't get caught.
But he stumbled and fell into the lake.

Wally saw the whole thing.
He also saw that Bennie the Bear was swimming in the lake, further in towards the deeper end.
Wally is used to seeing this.
Bennie loves swimming.

Wally returned his attention to Fiona.
He thought that maybe he can convince everyone that she's old enough to be a thief.
Maybe he can try to take a photograph of Fiona eating chicken on thanksgiving, and use that to frame her.
Or maybe he should put on a fox costume, and pretend to be Fiona stealing a chicken.
Or maybe he can manipulate Fiona into actually stealing a chicken, and Wally can make sure that she get's caught.

Later that week, Wally steels one of Mr. Finnigan's chickens.
This time he makes sure that Felix gets the blame.
It was only one chicken, and everyone assumes that Felix stole the chicken without a partner.

Later that month, Mr. Finnigan is at it again, setting up another trap for Felix.
This time, Wally tries to warn Felix, but Felix doesn't listen, and the trap springs.
Just like last time, Felix avoids the trap, but winds up on the lake again!
The next day, Mr. Finnigan finds that _many_ of his chickens are gone.
This time Wally is surpised as well, because he didn't do it!
Snooping around, Wally finds a trail of chicken feathers leading through the woods.
He followed the trail, leading to Bennie's den.
Wally was confused.
Bennie doesn't like to eat chickens. He eats garbage.

Wally peaked his head into Bennie's den.
There was Felix and Frido, sitting comfortably inside Bennie's den, sucking on chicken bones.

Wally ran away, looking for Fiona.
He found her near the foxes' den.

"Fiona", he says, "you're going to love this."

He leads Fiona back to Bennie's den. "Where are you taking me," Fiona asks along the way.

When they get there, Fiona peaks into Bennie's den and cries, "Dad, Grandpa! Then Wally asks, "why are you two here?"

Bennie says, "I saved them when they were drowning"

Wally says, 'Well, it's not nice to hide like that. You should tell everyone that you're alive."
