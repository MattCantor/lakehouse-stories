title: 'SCHOOL’S OUT! '
synopsis: Schools out for the WINTEEEEEER….
---

School was out for the winter. Gigi was going to leave Foresthood School for good and she wanted to say bye to her best friend Elli. Gigi and Elli were going to a camp at the Foresthood School. It was run by Ms Rachel and Principal Ralph and Larry the Lizard. It was an art camp. Fiona, Henry, Emo, Titi, and Clem were going too. Gigi and Elli were doing pottery with Fiona. Elli kind of forgot what pottery was and thought they were doing watercolors. That caused a bit of confusion, because Elli melted her pot when she put the watercolors on it. The camp was very fun and at the end of it both Elli and Gigi were very sad because they were never going to be in the same class again, so Elli had an idea.

Elli and Gigi went on a vacation together for the last weekend before spring. They were going to a brand new part of the forest. It had recently been announced that it was going to be turned into a national park! Elli’s mom had a new graveyard museum there, so they were moving to the park. Her uncle Eric was going to show Elli and Gigi around Elli’s new home, the highest rock pile in the park. 

As they were climbing up, Gigi fell and Elli and Eric didn’t notice. They climbed up and waited for her, but she never came up. They rushed down to see her trapped in between rocks. Elli went around the rock pile to find Gigi’s head stuck in between even more rocks. 

Elli pushed just as Eric pulled, and Gigi fell out. Elli jumped over the pile and caught Gigi. 

It was a great end for winter.
