School was out for the winter. Gigi was going to leave Foresthood School for good and she wanted to say bye to her best friend Elli. Gigi and Elli were going to a camp at the Foresthood School. It was run by Ms Rachel and Principal Ralph and Larry the Lizard. It was an art camp. Fiona, Henry, Emo, Titi, and Clem were going too. Gigi and Elli were doing pottery with Fiona. Elli kind of forgot what pottery was and thought they were doing watercolors. That caused a bit of confusion, because Elli melted her pot when she put the watercolors on it. The camp was very fun and at the end of it both Elli and Gigi were very sad because they were never going to be in the same class again, so Elli had an idea. 

Elli and Gigi went on a road trip for the last weekend before spring. They were going to a brand new part of the forest.
