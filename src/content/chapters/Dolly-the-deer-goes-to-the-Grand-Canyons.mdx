title: Dolly the deer goes to the Grand Canyon
synopsis: 'Will the whitetail deer has a bar-mitzvah '
---

Act 1

Dolly the deerâ€™s cousin, Will the whitetail deer, was having a bar-mitzvah in the Grand Canyon! Since the Grand Canyon is so far away, Dolly has to take a plane there. However, Dolly is terrified of planes. And airports. And cousins. And bar-mitzvahs. And uncles. And aunts. And grandparents. And any type of crater, but especially the Grand Canyon. So she was dreading the trip.

Once they got on the plane, Dolly started panicking. A plane? To the Grand Canyon? Where there would be a bar-mitzvah? For her cousin? With uncles, aunts, and grandparents there? Everything about it was terrifying!
