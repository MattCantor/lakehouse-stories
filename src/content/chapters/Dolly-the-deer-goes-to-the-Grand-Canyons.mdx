title: Dolly the deer goes to the Grand Canyon
synopsis: 'Will the whitetail deer has a bar-mitzvah '
---

Act 1

Dolly the deer’s cousin, Will the whitetail deer, was having a bar-mitzvah in the Grand Canyon! Since the Grand Canyon is so far away, Dolly has to take a plane there. However, Dolly is terrified of planes. And airports. And cousins. And bar-mitzvahs. And uncles. And aunts. And grandparents. And any type of crater, but especially the Grand Canyon. So she was dreading the trip.

Once they got on the plane, Dolly started panicking. A plane? To the Grand Canyon? Where there would be a bar-mitzvah? For her cousin? With uncles, aunts, and grandparents there? Everything about it was terrifying!

Act 2

Titi the turtle was also going to the Grand Canyon, but she was competing in the Olympics! She was doing track. She was the fastest animal in the forest, after all. She had done the same the last year, and she had been in the news! In gym class that year, Titi had to walk very slow so Willy the warthog would realize she was moving. She wore the gold medal she had won last year proudly.

Titi was so small that the seatbelt didn’t help her at all. She slipped on her seat, but a chicken underneath her bonked her back up. “That was weird,” she said. 

Act 3

The chickens wanted to come too. They were scared to be left alone. Even the biggest planes didn’t have even close to enough seats for all the chickens. So twenty-five chickens went underneath the seats of everyone on the biggest planes. Not including all the baby chickens.

 Cherry was laying down on the outside and kicked Titi up to her seat so the chickens wouldn’t be discovered. She was very proud of herself. She wondered if Mr. And Mrs. Finnigan were on the same plane as her.

Act 4

Mr. and Mrs. Finnigan wanted to have a funeral for Fredrick the fish (see “Mr finnigans pets”) and for some reason they decided to have it in the Grand Canyon. They brought Snoopy the snail with them and wore black. They invited all their friends and family, plus all the fish in the lake.

When they asked Fifi the fish to come she was silent for two minutes and Mr. Finnagin was about to hang up, but then Fifi asked “Is Snoopy coming?” Mr. Finnigan said yes. She screamed yes. 

Act 5

Fifi the fish was going to Fredrick the fish’s funeral, too, but only to see the love of her life, snoopy the snail. She planned to ask snoopy on a date at the funeral. Fifi the fish does not have many values. Of course, she didn’t MEAN to scream “yes” into the phone, it just happened! 

Act 6

Dolly the deer was having a panic attack. The plane was sort of spinning and her seat was sort of wobbling (this was because of the chickens). She was relieved when the plane ride ended. But the first thing she saw at the airport was a gigantic picture of the Grand Canyon.

Dolly the deer fainted.

Act 7

Wally the wolf liked being the mayor. But there were some city laws he hated. He was going to a politics meeting to talk about one issue: chicken-stealers getting arrested! 

He had his favorite book of chicken recipes with him. He also brought his wallet, and a ticket to the Museum Of Chicken, just in case he got bored. Benny the bear was sitting next to him, holding a ticket to the Worlds Biggest Dump plus a plate, fork, and spoon.
