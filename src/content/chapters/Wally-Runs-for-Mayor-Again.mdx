DO YOU REALLY WANT ZOHRAN MAMHOOTIE TO BE YOUR MAYOR? HE’S A PREDATOR AND POOPS IN TREES.

We need to free the chickens!

Vote Wally For Mayor, the Candidate you can Trust

////////////

\~\~\~\~ Forest animal primary, first debate \~\~\~\~\~

PENNY THE PORCUPINE: Hi, this is Penny coming to you live from the first debate of the forest animal primary campaign of the Forest Mayoral election.  I’m here to moderate this debate for extra credit, so my class can finally go on a field trip!

We have on the stage with us the incumbent mayor, Wally the Wolf.  And the challenger, Zohran Mamhootie the Owl.

First question, if you are elected mayor, will you visit Mr. Finnigan’s lake house?

WALLY: When I am elected Mayor, Mr. Finnigan’s house will be the first place I visit. It is important to our forest that the chickens are allowed to roam freely outside of their chicken coop, and stuff.

PENNY: Thank you Wally.  Now to you, Zohran, will you visit the chicken coop?

ZOHRAN: (sipping from a coffee mug, with the words ‘free cub care’).  My campaign is focused on affordability in the forest.  We will introduce free cub care, forest run fruit trees, and free and fast forest paths.

PENNY: But do you support the chickens’ right to roam freely outside their coop?

WALLY: He won’t say it.

ZOHRAN: I support the rights of all animals to live in their homes.

Well, this is probably the weirdest election the Lakehouse Forest has ever seen-I mean, since the last one. C’mon, there were about two million chickens voting! Even more chickens than the people. I, personally, didn’t know that Mr. Finnigan had so many. Is that guy adopting or do his chickens just make babies really fast? Anyways, enough about that last election. It was sooooo four years ago. This one is CRAZY! It’s Wally the Wolf V.S. Zohran Mamhootie the Owl, in case you didn’t know. By the way, have any of you guys noticed that Zohran Mamhootie is a really weird name for an owl? Shouldn’t it be, I dunno, Olly or Olivia or Oliver or even Ohran Omhootie? Just sayn’. Zohran has focused his campaign on affordability and stuff. It actually sound pretty good. But we all trust Wally, don’t we? (Okay, the chickens don’t, and they make up about half of our population, but still.) and here’s what Wally says:

ZOHRAN MAMHOOTIE IS A LYING CHEATER WHO DOESN’T SUPPORT CHICKEN RIGHTS BECAUSE HE EATS THEM FOR BREAKFAST AND HE HAS BAD BREATH ALSO AND HE IS A BIG MEANIE! VOTE WALLY THE WOLF!

In other election news, today I got the chance to speak with Zohran Mamhootie. “Zohran,” I ask him, “why don’t you think chickens should have the right to leave the coop?”

Zohran laughs and tells me the chickens are fine. For proof, he takes me to the chicken coop where he asks one if it likes living in the coop. (For the record, the chicken’s name was Charlie.) The chicken says the coop is awesome. Zohran shakes his head. “Clearly, Wally the Wolf is going off about nothing at all.”

Which clearly means….

ZOHRAN MAMHOOTIE BRAINWASHES CHICKENS AND STUFF!

Wally smiled as he read that morning’s newspaper. His campaign was going beautifully. Duh, because he was awesome at politics! Zohran Mamhootie was definitely going to lose. Everybody except the chickens trusted Wally. Especially because of the fact that he was running against a predator. That was great for campaign stuff.

But then Wally heard knocking at his door. After taking one last sip of coffee, he went to went to see who it was. It was Fiona the Fox. “Hi, Wally!” She said cheerfully. “Please vote for Zohran Mamhootie! He is awesome. If he is chosen for mayor, he will introduce UNIVERSAL FREE CUB CARE!”

Wally stared at Fiona. “Fiona,” he said, “I’m literally running against Zohran Mamhootie! There’s absolutely no way I would vote for him!”

“Oops!” She said, just as cheerful as before. “My mistake! I’ll go to Benny’s house instead. Goodbye, Wally! Hope you had a good breakfast!”

Wally shook his head as he finished reading his newspaper. The things kids come up with!

THE NEXT DAYS NEWSPAPER

Article By Benny the Bear

Folks, it’s really hard to believe that this is only the Forest Animal Primary. Zohran Mamhootie has sent a bunch of kids to be total nuisances about voting for him! I myself was interrupted in the middle of a nap after spending six straight hours a looking for garbage for that night’s dinner. Don’t get me wrong, I totally support taking a stand for what you believe in, but if the sign on the door says DO NOT DISTURB, y’ know, do not disturb. Anyways, enough about me. The deadline to vote is in only a week. And before you make your final decision, just hear me out-

VOTE WALLY THE WOLF NOT ZOHRAN MAMHOOTIE BECAUSE ZOHRAN MAMHOOTIE STEALS YOUR SLEEP BY SENDING ARMIES OF CHILDREN TO WAKE YOU UP IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR NAP TIME!!!

And remember: only Forest Animals can vote in the Forest Animal Primary. 

Wally yawned as he sipped his coffee. The newspapers were clearly in his favor. Or maybe that was just Benny. As mayor, Wally knew it was his duty to only read the politics section. 

What a shame that he was going to win. It would be nice to read about other things for once.
