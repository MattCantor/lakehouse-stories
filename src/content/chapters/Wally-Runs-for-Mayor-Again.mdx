\~\~\~\~ Forest animal primary, first debate \~\~\~\~\~

PENNY THE PORCUPINE: Hi, this is Penny coming to you live from the first debate of the forest animal primary campaign of the Forest Mayoral election.  I’m here to moderate this debate for extra credit, so my class can finally go on a field trip!

We have on the stage with us the incumbent mayor, Wally the Wolf.  And the challenger, Zohran Mamhootie the Owl.

First question, if you are elected mayor, will you visit Mr. Finnigan’s lake house?

WALLY: When I am elected Mayor, Mr. Finnigan’s house will be the first place I visit.  It is important to our forest that the chickens are allowed to roam freely outside of their chicken coop, and stuff.

PENNY: Thank you Wally.  Now to you, Zohran, will you visit the chicken coop?

ZOHRAN: (sipping from a coffee mug, with the words ‘free cub care’).  My campaign is focused on affordability in the forest.  We will introduce free cub care, forest run fruit trees, and free and fast forest paths.

PENNY: But do you support the chickens’ right to roam freely outside their coop.

WALLY: He won’t say it.

ZOHRAN: I support the rights of all animals to live in their homes.
