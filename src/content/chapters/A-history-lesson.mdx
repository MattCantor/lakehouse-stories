title: A history lesson
---

One morning in Rachel the Rabbit's class, Rachel the Rabbit was teaching her students about predators and prey.

Dolly the Deer raised her hoof. "Have we finished the mammal section yet?"

"Hmmm," said Rachel.  "We've done bears, foxes, humans - that was a tricky lesson wasn't it? - and....yup, all the other mammals too.  We have completed the mammals section, Dolly.

"So Wiwi isn't a mammal?" asked Fiona the Fox.

"What is Wiwi?" asked Penny the Porcupine.

"Wiwi is the largest land animal in Antartica," said Dolly.  "Everyone knows that."

"Ya but if Wiwi isn't a mammal, then what is he?" asked Fiona.

"I'm glad you asked," said Rachel.  "Our next section will be about bugs.  Wiwi is a bug.  But we've finished our predators and prey lesson for today.  Instead we're going to start a history unit.  We're going to learn about the exotic animals of the lakehouse forest and how they got here!"

"I'm not exotic," said Penny.

"I'm not exotic," said Fiona.

"I'm not exotic," said Dolly.

Willy the Warthog's class was taking a field trip in the Ampitheater right near Rachel's class.

"I'm not exotic," said Emo. "Exotisicm is a social construct anyway.  It's a subjective indication of one's own normative references.  It says more about the speaker than it does about the victim.  Exoticism is not a biological fact, unless my senses do defy me!"

"Ya, ok Emo," said Clem the Chameleon.

"You're exotically intelligent," said Titi the Turtle.

"What I mean is," said Rachel. "Some animals are exotic to the forest. Like Wiwi, who would normally live in Antartica.

"Wiwi isn't exotic," said Penny.

"Wiwi isn't exotic," said Fiona.

"Wiwi isn't exotic," said Dolly.

"Wiwi is exotic to the forest, like oxygen is to outerspace," said Emo.  "A most ubiquitous element but rare to find outside of its context."

"Ya, ok Emo," said Clem.

"You're exotically intelligent," said Titi.

Rachel sighed.  She knew that she was never going to get anywhere in her history lesson with these animals. "Ok, let's do reading," Rachel announced to the class.  "Everyone has to read Chapter 1 of Woby Wick by Charles Chickens. That's your assignment for this week.  Eventually you will be writing a book report on it. And your history assignment is finding an animal that's exotic in the forest, and writing a brief summary of how it got here."
