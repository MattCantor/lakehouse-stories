title: A history lesson
---

One morning in Rachel the Rabbit's class, Rachel the Rabbit was teaching her students about predators and prey.

Dolly the Deer raised her hoof. "Have we finished the mammal section yet?"

"Hmmm," said Rachel.  "We've done bears, foxes, humans - that was a tricky lesson wasn't it? - and....yup, all the other mammals too.  We have completed the mammals section, Dolly.

"So Wiwi isn't a mammal?" asked Fiona the Fox.

"What is Wiwi?" asked Penny the Porcupine.

"Wiwi is the largest land animal in Antartica," said Dolly.  "Everyone knows that."

"Ya but if Wiwi isn't a mammal, then what is he?" asked Fiona.

"I'm glad you asked," said Rachel.  "Our next section will be about bugs.  Wiwi is a bug.  But we've finished our predators and prey lesson for today.  Instead we're going to start a history unit.  We're going to learn about the exotic animals of the lakehouse forest and how they go here!"

"I'm not exotic," said Penny.

"I'm not exotic," said Fiona.

"I'm not exotic," said Dolly.

Willy the Warthog's class was taking a field trip in the Ampitheater right near Rachel's class.

"I'm not exotic," said Emo. "Exotisicm is a social construct anyway.  It's a subjective indication of one's own normative references.  It says more about the speaker than it does about the victim.  Exoticism is not a biological fact, unless my senses do defy me!"
