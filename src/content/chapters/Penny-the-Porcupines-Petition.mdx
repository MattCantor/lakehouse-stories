title: Penny the Porcupine's Petition
---

Penny the Porcupine really, really, wanted to go on a field trip. One day she had an idea. "I'm making a petition," she announced. The next day she went to Principal Ralph's office. "Principal Ralph," she said. "we *have *to go on a field trip!" "Why?" He asked. "Because," Penny replied, "I made a petition for people who think we should have a field trip! And I got a billion signatures!" Principal Ralph's eyes widened. "Really?" He asked.
