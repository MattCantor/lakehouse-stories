---

Penny the Porcupine really, really, wanted to go on a field trip. One day she had an idea. "I'm making a petition," she announced. The next day she went to Principal Ralph's office. "Principal Ralph," she said. "we *have* to go on a field trip!" "Why?" He asked. "Because," Penny replied, "I made a petition for people who think we should have a field trip! And I got a billion signatures!" Principal Ralph's eyes widened. "Really?" He asked. "Yeah!" she said, and showed him a long, long, long, long petition. The word 'petition' was at the top in block letters, and the rest was filled with lines that all said*: Penn*y the porkipine. "Umm...Penny," said Principal Ralph. "\*you \*wrote all of these. The whole point of a petition is to get signatures from a lot of people! But you \*do \*get extra credit for writing your name a billion times."
