Act l

L.I.C.E. (Lakehouse Immigration and Customs Enforcement) had come to the Lakehouse. L.I.C.E. Was there to get on the beavers heads and scare them away from the lake! Nobody knew why. All they knew was that L.I.C.E. was, as Emo the Ostrich put it, was “L.I.C.E is infringing on our personal freedoms and liberties, in a way that makes all of us less secure.” This was a follow-up to the question “What is immigration?” 

Ms. Rachel’s class was having a unit on peaceful protests. They learned about Martin Luther the Moose, Gandhi the Goose, and Nelson Mandela the Nightingale. Fiona the Fox, who was a family friend of Billy, Bernice and Bishup the Beavers, decided that her school should have a protest about L.I.C.E.

Emo made a sign that said “LIBERTY IS NOT JUST A WORD-WAIT, LIBERTY IS LIKE FREEDOM, RIGHT?” Penny made a sign saying “L.I.C.E. GETTING OUT, LIKE A FIELD TRIP, IS SOMETHING WE MUST HAVE AT ONCE!” A horse who would prefer not to be named had a sign saying “THESE L.I.C.E. ARE MAKING ME ITCHY!”

But where would they have the protest? 

Act ll 

Bishup the Beaver was making root soup with his mother Bernice. Fiona the Fox knocked on their door. “Fiona!” Bernice said. “What a wonderful surprise! Want some root soup?” Fiona stared at the soaked dug-up roots floating in pond water with maple leaves and bark chips. “I just ate,” she said apologetically. 

“Can we have an anti-L.I.C.E protest by your lodge?” She asked. Bernice smiled. “Absolutely!” She said happily. “We’ll bring enough root soup for everyone to enjoy!”
